The CeraVe Hydrating gentle cleanser is nice but it's a very different product. That's a gentle non-foaming cleanser which isn't going to be as universally appealing. But it is a good product :)  it's close to the Aveeno calm and restore oat cleanser (which I prefer over the CeraVe one but it's still good)

This is the cerave hydrating foaming oil cleanser I was referring to and it's just a more of conventional foaming cleanser but much gentler than many others

I like the PTR Water Drench is similar in texture and result! Very hydrating, very pricey - I used 1 $50 tub in a month. Although I did use a lot at once lol

Cosrx Hyaluronic Cream is very good too. I don't go through it nearly as quickly as above. The texture is not the same - it's kind of like Elmer's glue tbh. I like it though!

Image Vital C Hydrating Waterburst is great texture, thinner than hydroboost but a little goes a long way. Fragranced with essential oils which can be irritating but my skin doesn't mind. Also pricey.

2024-05-12 09:47:22,Review of a reformulated Neutrogena lotion,"Ugh I have beef with this bodylotion. The previous version was my holy grail bodylotion and face moisturizer, the new formulation is not it for me. 

It's a fine bodylotion on it's own for a lot of people probably, but for me it's a worse product now.
The previous version was lightweight, moisturizing and occulsive without feeling sticky or greasy and it sank in quickly without leaving a trace after applying it. 
The new one is still lightweight but way less occulsive, feels slightly greasy on the skin in direct comparison with my last remains of the old version and it takes ages to sink into the skin properly.
In addition the new pump is horrible, it always jams for no reason and they hiked up the price by almost 25% (new formula: 250ml - 3,45€ - 13,80€/L, old formula: 400ml - 4,45€ - 11,13€/L) 

I'm currently using it up on my body while I'm searching for alternatives, but I can't use it on my face at all like the previous version. It's pilling and it feels sticky and just gross which is disappointing. 
I have such a hard time finding moisturizers and bodylotions without hyaluronic acid or niacinamide or fragrances that truly sink into the skin without leaving a trace or feeling sticky or greasy. Sorry for being a bit dramatic about it, this reformulation truly gutted me when I found out about it.",https://i.redd.it/3smqgi9yhuzc1.png,Reddit,English,negative,0.8974362015724182,2024-05-06,2024-05-12

I have oily skin, and i live in a humid coastal city where summer is hot. I tried this product recently and this product just sits on my skin and leaves it feeling tacky (chip chip). It doesn't get absorbed. 

I took it along on a holiday on a hill station where the weather was pleasant during morning and evening (the times I apply skincare) and so it was tad better in settling. But if you run hand over cheek, you could feel some gel like layer. Basically again no absorption. 

Being a gel based product, it didn't suit me. Also the whole cream is full of finely milled shimmer particles. They don't stick out on application, but if this is their mechanism of bright boost then it's a shame of a product.",https://i.redd.it/uxs99cnfsm0d1.jpeg,Reddit,English,negative,0.5990496277809143,2024-05-13,2024-05-16
