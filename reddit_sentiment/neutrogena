I can’t get behind the smell of the reformulated neutrogena. It has something off about it. Additionally it doesn’t absorb and dry down the same way as the original formulation.

2024-04-23 03:21:39,How different is the new Neutrogena ultra sheer sunscreen compared to the old formula? ,"Copying my response to another sub member for same Q :

I started a new tube few weeks back. 
{ Been using this sunscreen for years, My skin type is dry in winters and normal/combo in summers}. 
The new version feels thicker in consistency- it isn't as runny or as lotion-like as before. Performance more or less feels the same. I do feel that earlier version used to spread on face very quickly, this I apply in small sections now as texture feels just a tad thicker. 

I used to love the dewiness I got from older version- it would kind of brighten up my skin. This one has less of that effect honestly. But on the plus side the new one's finish is not as sticky/tacky as last one. It isn't matte finish but at the same time the tackyness is reduced by a few degrees.

I don't get a white cast, with older or new version. 

To answer your Q- the changes are subtle, not drastic and you can buy it. It has been on heavy discounts on myntra off and on (like 50%) in the past 2 months, so keep a look out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/1c9hryc/how_different_is_the_new_neutrogena_ultra_sheer/,Reddit,English,NEGATIVE,0.9944069385528564

So far my skin is still dry (it turns around this time in the heat). The Neutrogena one is my go to sunscreen. I hardly ever try others, the dermat recommended ones (La Shield, Acne UV) feel siliconey and slightly heavy to me. When humidity gets higher in summers I do get oilier and with sweat the face looks greasy. No sunscreen can change that. Maybe you can get something like Innisfree No Sebum Mineral powder for that?


I tried Loreal Matte n Fresh once and it was nice. Biore watery Essence was similar to Neutrogena in performance but just a tad more sticky for me. I can't vouch for their sun protection as I only used them once. To test. 

Moisturisers - well that's another saga. I use atleast 2/3 at any point of time. Depending on my skin.
In summers for day time I prefer light moisturisers like Simple Light or Sebamed Face Clear gel. If I need more, due to dryness, I use Venusia in a tub (it's my go to moisturiser in all weather,  it's like a gel creme and very safe ingredients for sensitive skin). Always apply on damp skin. For PM I have used Venusia/Formula RX Barrier Relief Plus/ Bioderma Créme.  The last is best to tackle dry spots overnight but slightly tacky finish. I use it sparingly. The Formula RX one is also a great cream moisturiser, absorbs well, you need very little, can be used in AM as well. Also snail mucin essence was great for me for soothing and hydration (I have sensitive skin).

I'll need to look for scientific evidence of this. If so, then that may explain why Neutrogena quietly discontinued it, since theoretically if the company were to explain a potential health risk, it could open itself up to legal liability for knowingly selling a harmful product.

It's such a bummer to me that T/Gel has been discontinued. I just bought another coal-tar shampoo on Amazon to test it out, but nothing else I've tried works nearly as well.

2024-05-12 09:47:22,Review of a reformulated Neutrogena lotion,"Ugh I have beef with this bodylotion. The previous version was my holy grail bodylotion and face moisturizer, the new formulation is not it for me. 

It's a fine bodylotion on it's own for a lot of people probably, but for me it's a worse product now.
The previous version was lightweight, moisturizing and occulsive without feeling sticky or greasy and it sank in quickly without leaving a trace after applying it. 
The new one is still lightweight but way less occulsive, feels slightly greasy on the skin in direct comparison with my last remains of the old version and it takes ages to sink into the skin properly.
In addition the new pump is horrible, it always jams for no reason and they hiked up the price by almost 25% (new formula: 250ml - 3,45€ - 13,80€/L, old formula: 400ml - 4,45€ - 11,13€/L) 

I'm currently using it up on my body while I'm searching for alternatives, but I can't use it on my face at all like the previous version. It's pilling and it feels sticky and just gross which is disappointing. 
I have such a hard time finding moisturizers and bodylotions without hyaluronic acid or niacinamide or fragrances that truly sink into the skin without leaving a trace or feeling sticky or greasy. Sorry for being a bit dramatic about it, this reformulation truly gutted me when I found out about it.",https://i.redd.it/3smqgi9yhuzc1.png,Reddit,English,NEGATIVE,0.9989645481109619

2024-05-16 08:16:21,NEUTROGENA Bright Boost (gel cream),"If you are looking for a review:

I have oily skin, and i live in a humid coastal city where summer is hot. I tried this product recently and this product just sits on my skin and leaves it feeling tacky (chip chip). It doesn't get absorbed. 

I took it along on a holiday on a hill station where the weather was pleasant during morning and evening (the times I apply skincare) and so it was tad better in settling. But if you run hand over cheek, you could feel some gel like layer. Basically again no absorption. 

Being a gel based product, it didn't suit me. Also the whole cream is full of finely milled shimmer particles. They don't stick out on application, but if this is their mechanism of bright boost then it's a shame of a product.",https://i.redd.it/uxs99cnfsm0d1.jpeg,Reddit,English,NEGATIVE,0.9645520448684692

Image Vital C Hydrating Waterburst is great texture, thinner than hydroboost but a little goes a long way. Fragranced with essential oils which can be irritating but my skin doesn't mind. Also pricey.

2024-01-01 23:59:52,Neutrogena hydroboost helpful?,"I just use a local pharmacy moisturizer (non-US), but here's a few of the most regularly recommended heavier moisturizers on here:

- La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume
- Vanicream Moisturizing lotion/cream
- Cerave
- Avene Cicalfate

Although I don't use any of them currently, I can confirm that they are all generally well tolerated and non-irritating :) The Cicaplast and Cicalfate both have zinc which can leave a bit of a white cast if you use too much, so keep that in mind.

You could also try just layering a thin layer of vaseline or aquaphor over your hydroboost. Doesn't work for everyone, but it's great if you can tolerate it!

Edit: but also keep in mind that Rosacea is very individual. Some people simply can't handle heavier moisturizers no matter how much their skin craves it. If you find that it's making your skin worse, don't try to push through it and instead try to find other ways of keeping your skin hydrated.

Also for shiprocket we need to do KYC in their app(enter bank details) as a minimum amount of 500 should be deposited in the wallet, when paying from shipment you pay through the wallet amount can't pay through our UPI. You can withdraw the money back by raising a ticket or by sending them an email.


For Shiprocket packages you need to take a printout of the label(this is provided after shipment is confirmed) and paste it on your box and pack it well. You can schedule the pickup as per your requirement and the courier guy will come and pick your order.


Tracking link will be sent to the buyer too and you can track the package from the app",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bjz6ta,Reddit,English,NEGATIVE,0.9486179947853088
