2024-01-19 17:05:48,[Product question] Thoughts on the Neutrogena HYDRO BOOST moisturizer,"I’m kind of bummed that my skin prefers this water gel to other more fancy hydrating serums (I’m still trying to find something better). 

My skin is very dry on its own. So for me this water gel works best underneath another moisturizer. I put it on damp skin after washing my face and after it has sunk in a little bit (not completely dry) I layer Weleda Skin Food Light on top. 

When I skip the water gel and only use the moisturizer then my skin doesn’t feel as good so it has become an important step.

I did try some store brands over time that were better than the new formulation of Hydroboost (which I find rather amusing in a twisted way, that they fucked it up so badly even the cheapest store brand moisturizer from supermarket for less than 3€ can suck less than that devils cum in jar they sell now), but none really came close to the original formulation.

If u do end up finding stg please, let me know.

On the plus side though: I don't believe the new formulation is selling any better than the old one, on the contrary n I feel (or more like hope) it is only a matter of time until they are forced to reformulate it yet again, or better yet go back to the old formulation.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15iu37b,Reddit,English

2023-12-27 20:27:27,Neutrogena T Gel ever coming back?,"T/Sal is garbage. My backup solution is ""T+Plus"" (yes, double plus?) sold in Texas at HEB stores generally, but surprise it's out of stock online.

But it works.  

I also have a prescription for Ketoconazole 2% shampoo, which is basically Nizoral with more oomph, so maybe worth asking your doctor.

2024-05-12 09:47:22,Review of a reformulated Neutrogena lotion,"Ugh I have beef with this bodylotion. The previous version was my holy grail bodylotion and face moisturizer, the new formulation is not it for me. 

It's a fine bodylotion on it's own for a lot of people probably, but for me it's a worse product now.
The previous version was lightweight, moisturizing and occulsive without feeling sticky or greasy and it sank in quickly without leaving a trace after applying it. 
The new one is still lightweight but way less occulsive, feels slightly greasy on the skin in direct comparison with my last remains of the old version and it takes ages to sink into the skin properly.
In addition the new pump is horrible, it always jams for no reason and they hiked up the price by almost 25% (new formula: 250ml - 3,45€ - 13,80€/L, old formula: 400ml - 4,45€ - 11,13€/L) 

I'm currently using it up on my body while I'm searching for alternatives, but I can't use it on my face at all like the previous version. It's pilling and it feels sticky and just gross which is disappointing. 
I have such a hard time finding moisturizers and bodylotions without hyaluronic acid or niacinamide or fragrances that truly sink into the skin without leaving a trace or feeling sticky or greasy.

I have oily skin, and i live in a humid coastal city where summer is hot. I tried this product recently and this product just sits on my skin and leaves it feeling tacky (chip chip). It doesn't get absorbed. 

I took it along on a holiday on a hill station where the weather was pleasant during morning and evening (the times I apply skincare) and so it was tad better in settling. But if you run hand over cheek, you could feel some gel like layer. Basically again no absorption. 

Being a gel based product, it didn't suit me. Also the whole cream is full of finely milled shimmer particles. They don't stick out on application, but if this is their mechanism of bright boost then it's a shame of a product.",https://i.redd.it/uxs99cnfsm0d1.jpeg,Reddit,English

Cosrx Hyaluronic Cream is very good too. I don't go through it nearly as quickly as above. The texture is not the same - it's kind of like Elmer's glue tbh. I like it though!

Image Vital C Hydrating Waterburst is great texture, thinner than hydroboost but a little goes a long way. Fragranced with essential oils which can be irritating but my skin doesn't mind. Also pricey.

2024-01-01 23:59:52,Neutrogena hydroboost helpful?,"I just use a local pharmacy moisturizer (non-US), but here's a few of the most regularly recommended heavier moisturizers on here:

- La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume
- Vanicream Moisturizing lotion/cream
- Cerave
- Avene Cicalfate

Although I don't use any of them currently, I can confirm that they are all generally well tolerated and non-irritating :) The Cicaplast and Cicalfate both have zinc which can leave a bit of a white cast if you use too much, so keep that in mind.

You could also try just layering a thin layer of vaseline or aquaphor over your hydroboost. Doesn't work for everyone, but it's great if you can tolerate it!

Edit: but also keep in mind that Rosacea is very individual. Some people simply can't handle heavier moisturizers no matter how much their skin craves it. If you find that it's making your skin worse, don't try to push through it and instead try to find other ways of keeping your skin hydrated.

2024-02-02 08:34:09,Ordered Neutrogena Hydroboost watergel from Kult for 188 (review below),I agree it’s a little tooo heavy for the summers especially in Mumbai’s hot humid climate so I had switched to using ponds gel crème but didn’t like that (fragrance was so strong and overall not moisturising enough) so again went back to cetaphil,https://i.redd.it/v5jtm184z3gc1.jpeg,Reddit,English

I will say, I've been testing out the new Naked Sundays mineral cabana glow and I really like it for under makeup!! It's wayyyy too shimmery with the 1/4 teaspoon measurement for full sun protection to wear without makeup (at least with all my skin texture and breakouts) but it's really pretty as a primer, hasn't made my breakouts worse, is unscented, and MINERAL!! I used the shade pearl but honestly could probably wear the illuminated shade but that one has more of a yellow tint while pearl is more pink. I'd say it's a pretty good mineral dupe of glowscreen",https://i.redd.it/wf6tuyfyhhgc1.jpeg,Reddit,English
