            "Yea, I started getting burning and dry out after awhile. I’m guessing it’s bc it pulls moisture so after awhile it has nothing to pull out. So I started doing lush/cerave face lotion on fri-sun and noticed the neutrogena didn’t burn anymore again bc I’m guessing it had oil and moisture to actually pull from. Other than that it’s the go to moisturizer if you’re having an acne breakout bc it has 0 oil and will moisturize it while not adding to the oily-ness of the area and it heals a lot faster and doesn’t come back over and over like the infamous lush blackheads you get when you use their face pods every day (this is coming from an average dude who had a target gift card so take this info with a grain of salt lol) 0.01\n",

I would really love if at some point you could do a broad drugstore skincare review for us, I have switched a few of my higher end products to a few that you recommended from The Ordinary line and have saved so much money.

I used it over 15 years ago and remembered it drying out my skin a bit but that’s it. I had some congestion on my chin from wearing masks and wanted to clear it up. I used it for 2 days and I broke out in an burning, itchy, bumpy, red rash all over my face! It took me 3 painful days and 50$ worth of medications/antihistamines later to clear it up. All because of a 10$ face wash. Now I’m dealing with excessively dry skin (I have oily skin) that flakes from the medications I used to clear the rash. It was one of the worst purchases I’ve ever made. And to think they say on the back of the bottle that this can be used up to 3 times a day. It’s too harsh, even for normal skin. It’ll take me some time before I can ever think of touching a neutrogena product again. Polarity not available\n",

Other than that it’s the go to moisturizer if you’re having an acne breakout bc it has 0 oil and will moisturize it while not adding to the oily-ness of the area and it heals a lot faster and doesn’t come back over and over like the infamous lush blackheads you get when you use their face pods every day (this is coming from an average dude who had a target gift card so take this info with a grain of salt lol) Polarity not available\n",
