youtube,"I have acne-prone oily/combo skin and I fell in love hard with the original hydro-boost gel formula when it came out. I was doing some research in skincare and investing in a routine that was simple, sustainable, and effective (which for me meant: reducing acne severity and frequency of breakouts and improving overall hydration without feeling greasy. Greasy/thick formulas almost always meant causing a flare up of cystic acne)

It was magical. It absorbs immediately, it feels cooling, and it’s so lightweight. I still go back to it whenever I run out. This video really helped me better understand the differences in the new formulas though! thank you so much!! I’m interested in trying the cream as a nighttime moisturizer as you suggested, but i will proceed with caution… Like I said, my skin does NOT generally like thicker formulas.",GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-05-20,,

youtube,"I’ve had the worst luck with the new formulas. I’ve tried 3. There is a new photo/formula on my purchase history photos of the original formula (gel-cream extra dry). I tried that one, and it burned my skin…turned me super red, which is abnormal for me. I had flaky stinging skin around my eyebrows and nose creases. I couldn’t give that one a long try, because within 2 weeks my skin was shriveling up like a prune with exaggerated fine lines and just red and sad. I tried the water gel like in this video and within 48 hours I had a huge cyst like sore…a blister?… on the side of my face where I have never broken out before - ever. I decided to keep trying it … within the 3 weeks I persisted, my skin was hydrated and looking better, but I received 3 more blisters in odd places on my face that I’ve never been prone to breaking out. It was painful both physically and mentally. I gave up. I’m so sad. I have normal-to-dry skin, that reacts poorly to fragrance and dyes. I don’t wear makeup other than mascara and never needed to. I never dealt with acne until the Covid mask mandate. I’m still searching for a product that will work similarly to the original gel-cream extra dry. It’s been 5 months now and my skin isn’t how it was with that holy-grail  product. I’m so discouraged by this…like it really bothers me!",GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-04-03,,

youtube,"The new product is terrible. Why are the top comments praising this? Nobody is mentioning the 3rd ingredient is Isopropyl Palmitate which is highly comedogenic. As well, urea (in both formulas) is a known trigger to some individuals with sensitive skin. It’s funny how at 1:55 in the video you mention rosacea, hinting at this product helping due to its moisturizing properties, but fail to mention the fact THE PRODUCT ITSELF triggers flare ups. I used this and my cheeks were alarmingly red almost immediately afterwards and they still are at the end of the day. Why don’t you mention this? You are a doctor, after all. Oh, right, because you’re affiliated with Neutrogena… I won’t be relying on any of your product reviews going forward.",GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-02-27,,

youtube,"I picked up the water gel randomly as my first moisturizer. I LOVE the way this feels when I put it on! I get so excited. It’s refreshing. 

Idk if it’s because I’m 36 or if I have some issue, but in the past year my forehead has developed wrinkles and I now have mouth lines and this weird big line on my face and my cheeks have a texture instead of normal. Like a spongey rock look. 

So I’m developing a skin care routine for the first time ever. I’m using OLAY Eyes as suggested by my mom. Putting it under my eyes and on the sides. And on smile lines. Then I’m doing the neutrogena moisturizer over. This is when I’m not at work. On days I work, I’m just doing moisturizer and skipping OLAY. Idk why. Just in case it looks weird. 

Then at night I do 2 serums this local guy made. One has hyslouronic acid. Hope I’m not getting too much hyaluroni c acid between my night serum and morning moisturizer.

So far after a few weeks I’m not sure I see a difference but maybe time will tell. 

My nails also look weird and my throat is really dry and so are my lips so perhaps bloodwork will show I have some dehydration issue idk.",GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-02-23,,

youtube,"I'm currently trying out the German version of the water gel for my combination skin (only available in fragranced and dyed). I love the summery scent, the blue color and the pudding-like consistency. The matte finish is also very appealing to me. Plus, my skin is getting less oily than usual.
During the day under sun protection, the cream usually moisturizes my skin for a long time.
At night, however, it does not keep my skin moisturized that long - when I wake up in the morning, my skin feels tight and dehydrated.
In addition it burns quite unpleasantly on my skin for another 10 minutes after application. Around the eyes, it leaves the skin irritated for a while.

Update about 1 month later:
Still burning and redness on my skin when applying. Doesn’t give long hydration. Skin feels tight 10 mins after application.

youtube,Thank you so much Dr Dray for all of your awesome helpful videos 😊 I suffer with severe eczema so I’m definitely going to try the cream one my face stays so dry all the time~I get embarrassed when people stare at me because of my eczema 😞 that I tend to stay in my home unless I have to go see my dermatologist.,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-05,,
youtube,Honestly some changes are for good. I prefer the new creamy formula to the gel based that never did too much to my skin. The only gel based product that works for me is the one from Bioderma.,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-05,,
youtube,I used the old version a few years ago because I'm oily skin and it really helped to control the oil production. I changed to different moisturizer over the years and I still repurchase sometimes but I don't like jars because I have hygiene issues with dipping my hands in the whole jar. I prefer tubes and pumps for more hygiene. 😅,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-05,,
youtube,I am so sad they discontinued it. I LOVED it and when this arrived I thought I made a mistake in my order. I’m not impressed with it at all. Sadly the old formula seemed better to me.,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-05,,
youtube,"I used the old formula (gel) at night and it always felt so heavy on my face. I am a fan of a moisturizer that dries down completely. I am combo leaning oily.

youtube,I just found this gel about a month ago and I love it. I'm 68 and always been oily.  This is great for me. Thanks for the new info.,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-05,,
youtube,"I actually had no idea that the Gel one was different, even after using it lol, I just checked and sure enough the new one I just got and already have used is the newer one (not the cream, the gel) lol. I thought it was a just new packaging, though I did see the cream version, which I thought was new, but didn't realize the gel had been replaced with a new version lol. It doesn't feel any different to me so far, as far as the texture, so I love that it didn't change anything and I have sensitive skin, so I'm glad that it didn't cause a reaction, since I didn't do a patch test, since again, I didn't realize it was a different product lol. But we'll see if it has a better effect on my skin over time than the other one did and I do have dry skin, but hate the feel of thicker lotions. Especially since I wear glasses and can't stand when it makes my glasses slide around and I end up with those red marks due to friction of the glasses moving so much, so even though gel probably isn't the best for dry skin, it worked better for me. However, I've been considering using gel during the day, then a thicker one at night, (I've never used a different one at night, since I'm disabled and can't afford to splurge on skincare, even on drugstore unless it's very cheap and I find Neutrogena to be a bit up there in price for drugstore, but it's the only moisturizer I didn't hate lol, so it's definitely considered a splurge for me). But I didn't want to buy one, then end up not liking it, since that would be money wasted, which I can't afford and I live in a small town, so the nearest Walmart is around 40 minutes away, so returning things isn't easy when we only go once a month, due to budget with gas and all that. But the water cream actually sounds like it might be a good option, since it's supposed to absorb fast and is from a line I trust, so I might try that out if I can find the smaller, more affordable size to test out before getting the bigger one. I'm hopeful, since the Hydro Boost line has been one of my favorite lines of all time, the only time one caused issues was when I accidentally got the fragranced version of the body gel lotion, but I gave that one to my grandma and got the fragrance free version and that one was perfect. (I'm very sensitive to fragrances in all skincare, including Deodorant, so I don't use fragranced products unless it's completely unavoidable, so I'm very very glad these products don't have fragrance).",GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-05,,

Be careful what you grab because the 'old formulations' are still in stock/available on the shelves (they too are labeled 'HYDRO BOOST GEL CREAM' or 'HYDRO BOOST GEL CREAM SPF 25').

youtube,"So that's what's going on. I needed a new jar of my holy grail moisturizer about two weeks ago and was very confused! 
I used to apply the 'water gel' sometimes under a more occlusive cream or sunscreen  and sometimes just as is. Always worked great for me. I thought, the 'water cream' might be a good alternative for winter, being a bit more occlusive, but I'm not totally sold. I just don't like it quite as much. It absorbs fast enough, true, but leaves a 'silicon-y' feel on my skin, which I don't enjoy (even though I know, it's not a bad thing). And it most certainly doesn't keep my skin hydrated for 72hours. It's always a bit dry and oily towards the late afternoon, when I come home from work. It's due to the dry, heated air inside, of course, but the cream most certainly doesn't keep that promise. Not even on my very 'robust' and healthy skin. I also have to clean the area around my eyes very carefully with very diluted alcohol, before I apply mascara later on. Again, that damn silicon layer. It sits on my skin and smudges my mascara within an hour or so. Didn't have that problem with the 'water gel'. I'll use it up and give the other option a try as well...but so far, this is not an improvement for me, unfortunately.",GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,
youtube,I bought the water cream formula and works fine with me :),GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,
youtube,"My country (Philippines) J&J still sells the old formula, the new formula isn't available here yet and because of this video I'll wait for the newer formula instead",GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,
youtube,It's nice to see that they replaced the old product with 2 that are truly improved.  Thanks for letting us know!,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,
youtube,Is the application to the skin the same as the previous one ?,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,
youtube,"They are not an improvement, the gel cream is more like a lotion, not a gel cream and it burns😢",GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,
youtube,I keep asking if this happens to anyone—using products with ceramides causes hard knots in my chin. Anyone else? And anyone know why?,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,
youtube,The original was not moisturising enough for me,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,
youtube,"I loved the original fragrance-free Hydro-Boost formula but, it wasn't quite moisturizing enough for my mature/dry skin. I always applied another moisturizer over it to seal it in. I used it as a gel-serum. Happy to hear the new cream is also fragrance free and has more emollients in it. 👍",GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,
youtube,Been using this for years on Dray’s recommendation & now my wife & mom use it as well.,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,

youtube,Thank you Dr Dray for the updated information! I was going to purchase some new products this weekend.,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,
youtube,"I just got the scented equate version, definitely not for sensitive skin! I hope they keep it on the market tho, i just wanted it for the sensory feels & the humectant boost. I do wish watery gels were standardly frag-free tho, that's exactly the texture you want when your skin is mad! I find essence's cica cream is the best for actually soothing my skin, but i love the sensation of a water gel...i got a wonderful  tarte one in boxy, but no way am i paying high end prices for a nice sensation on my skin lol...",GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,
youtube,They hydro boosted the price of that Water Cream. It's $28.49 at Target. 👀,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,
youtube,Thanks so much for this info! 😊,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,
youtube,I am currently using this for the first time. Used 2/3 of it so far. Not impressed though. It feels like a hyaluronic acid serum.,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,
youtube,I will try both of them. So sad about my morning gel cream. I am going to morn it. I have used it for years. As long as I I have been watching you!,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,
youtube,"Dr dray, thank you for all that you do. I was wondering if you could address the issue of zits inside your nose! I'm currently suffering from one. Just wanted to know whether they were like regular zits or whether something else was going on, and what I could do to possibly treat it. I was thinking maybe you could do it in conjunction with other weird things in other parts of your body like your eyes, like styes, or in your ears LOL. Anyway, wishing you a wonderful New Year❤🎉",GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,

youtube,Relief! Haha,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,
youtube,It sure is sad that the old formula has been completely discontinued and here in Greece we only had that option of fragrance free Neutrogena moisturizer 😢. But maybe in due time they will come here too. The water cream won me i say that 😊❤. Neutrogena sure did not disappoint when it comes to boosting our moods and skin's hydration ❤.,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,

youtube,"Dr. Dray I have used Neutrogena for years.  I always used their Fresh Foaming Cleanser and their Sensitive Skin Oil Free Moisturizer.  It was my staple for years and were many people’s holy grails!  Well they discontinued both!  I’m still working on my stock, but once they’re gone it’s over.  I’m 62 years old with extremely sensitive on the oilier side skin, I’m so stressed thinking about having to find something else!  Maybe this new water gel version will be something that will work for me.. 🙏.. Thank you so much for this video!! Happy New Year to you and yours! 🩷🌸",GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,
youtube,Do you still put an occlusive moisturizer over the water cream like the old version? Or do you not now that it has more moisturizing ingredients?,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,
youtube,"I, too, went looking for the now discontinued Neutrogena Hydro Boost Cream Gel and couldn't find it, then saw the ""new"" Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Cream.  I absolutely love, love, love it!  It is a bit harder to get it out of the jar (wish it had a little spatula), as it seems a little slick to me, but it is a great daytime moisturizer for me!

youtube,I tried it but Wasn’t a big fan. I think maybe it burned my skin or something I can’t remember. I’m also Not a fan of hyaluronic acid in everything because then it’s a two step process because you have to seal it in for it to be effective,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-01-04,,

youtube,"Cleanse your facial skin with cold water - it does wonders for your skin, giving it a natural glow. Splash cold water on your face first thing in the morning, and when you return from office, and prior to sleep at night. Don't use hot water as it can cause your face look dull. Always use a soft, mild face wash like Littlleextra Ricebberry Face Wash, infused with black rice water, which is ten times more helpful than regular white rice water. It maintains your skin hydrated, eliminates excess oil and dirt, prevents acne, and keeps your face glowing after just one wash in morning.",ZdcunHkMv6k,2024-03-12,,

It used to be only whenever I made a face, and then then last year it was only in certain lighting. Now it’s becoming to where you can just see a big wrinkly forehead no matter what. Just to paint the picture of what I’m like.

But how often do I need to use this cream? I know it’s not prescription cream. But for now I’m trying it like once per week. Maybe twice per week. Sometimes I do see redness in the face a few days later and I’m not sure if it’s from this or if it’s Just normal. So I don’t want to use too much mainly because I don’t want my coworkers to see that I’m using a product. But if I need to use it more often I can. Do you build a tolerance? Sounds like it from the way you are talking. I personally don’t put it on at night because then what if I rub it in my eyes? Or if it gets on my pillowcase and stuff like that.

I was putting it on my mouth lines and crows feet and I went ahead and just did my forehead anyway.

There's a dermatologist on YouTube that was saying how there's a product that's really good for textural and skin pigmentation issues apparently it's at Target so let's go look for it is it me or is the outside of this La Target nicer than most targets okay let's go look for this hyaluronic acid retinol thing that the dermatologist on YouTube was talking about hey can you change the light please you want me to turn the light purple for you yes can you please do it faster thank you this product is not recommended for beginners luckily I'm not a beginner so let's put this on the texture is very light but it has hyaluronic acid so it still feels super moisturizing and this eye cream people have been saying that it's amazing for Fine Lines around the eyes and I've seen some pretty impressive before and afters I love how this feels on the skin the combination of hyaluronic acid and retinol is definitely a win",-Rsh6Ub1Xkw,2024-02-24,,
