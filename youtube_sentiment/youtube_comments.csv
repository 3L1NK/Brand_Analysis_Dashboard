2024-05-20,*NEW* Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Cream And Water Gel Review,"I have acne-prone oily/combo skin and I fell in love hard with the original hydro-boost gel formula when it came out. I was doing some research in skincare and investing in a routine that was simple, sustainable, and effective (which for me meant: reducing acne severity and frequency of breakouts and improving overall hydration without feeling greasy. Greasy/thick formulas almost always meant causing a flare up of cystic acne)

It was magical. It absorbs immediately, it feels cooling, and it‚Äôs so lightweight. I still go back to it whenever I run out. This video really helped me better understand the differences in the new formulas though! thank you so much!!

I had flaky stinging skin around my eyebrows and nose creases. I couldn‚Äôt give that one a long try, because within 2 weeks my skin was shriveling up like a prune with exaggerated fine lines and just red and sad.

I don‚Äôt wear makeup other than mascara and never needed to. I never dealt with acne until the Covid mask mandate.

Nobody is mentioning the 3rd ingredient is Isopropyl Palmitate which is highly comedogenic. As well, urea (in both formulas) is a known trigger to some individuals with sensitive skin. It‚Äôs funny how at 1:55 in the video you mention rosacea, hinting at this product helping due to its moisturizing properties, but fail to mention the fact THE PRODUCT ITSELF triggers flare ups. I used this and my cheeks were alarmingly red almost immediately afterwards and they still are at the end of the day. Why don‚Äôt you mention this? You are a doctor, after all.

2024-02-23,*NEW* Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Cream And Water Gel Review,"I picked up the water gel randomly as my first moisturizer. I LOVE the way this feels when I put it on! I get so excited. It‚Äôs refreshing. 

Idk if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm 36 or if I have some issue, but in the past year my forehead has developed wrinkles and I now have mouth lines and this weird big line on my face and my cheeks have a texture instead of normal. Like a spongey rock look. 

So I‚Äôm developing a skin care routine for the first time ever. I‚Äôm using OLAY Eyes as suggested by my mom. Putting it under my eyes and on the sides. And on smile lines. Then I‚Äôm doing the neutrogena moisturizer over. This is when I‚Äôm not at work. On days I work, I‚Äôm just doing moisturizer and skipping OLAY. Idk why. Just in case it looks weird. 

Then at night I do 2 serums this local guy made. One has hyslouronic acid. Hope I‚Äôm not getting too much hyaluroni c acid between my night serum and morning moisturizer.

So far after a few weeks I‚Äôm not sure I see a difference but maybe time will tell. 

My nails also look weird and my throat is really dry and so are my lips so perhaps bloodwork will show I have some dehydration issue idk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJOHSaNyb4E,youtube,en

2024-02-09,*NEW* Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Cream And Water Gel Review,"I'm currently trying out the German version of the water gel for my combination skin (only available in fragranced and dyed). I love the summery scent, the blue color and the pudding-like consistency. The matte finish is also very appealing to me. Plus, my skin is getting less oily than usual.
During the day under sun protection, the cream usually moisturizes my skin for a long time.
At night, however, it does not keep my skin moisturized that long - when I wake up in the morning, my skin feels tight and dehydrated.
In addition it burns quite unpleasantly on my skin for another 10 minutes after application. Around the eyes, it leaves the skin irritated for a while.

Update about 1 month later:
Still burning and redness on my skin when applying. Doesn‚Äôt give long hydration. Skin feels tight 10 mins after application.
I will not purchase it again.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJOHSaNyb4E,youtube,en

2024-01-05,*NEW* Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Cream And Water Gel Review,I used the old version a few years ago because I'm oily skin and it really helped to control the oil production.

2024-01-05,*NEW* Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Cream And Water Gel Review,"I used the old formula (gel) at night and it always felt so heavy on my face. I am a fan of a moisturizer that dries down completely. I am combo leaning oily.

2024-01-05,*NEW* Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Cream And Water Gel Review,"I actually had no idea that the Gel one was different, even after using it lol, I just checked and sure enough the new one I just got and already have used is the newer one (not the cream, the gel) lol. I thought it was a just new packaging, though I did see the cream version, which I thought was new, but didn't realize the gel had been replaced with a new version lol. It doesn't feel any different to me so far, as far as the texture, so I love that it didn't change anything and I have sensitive skin, so I'm glad that it didn't cause a reaction, since I didn't do a patch test, since again, I didn't realize it was a different product lol. But we'll see if it has a better effect on my skin over time than the other one did and I do have dry skin, but hate the feel of thicker lotions. Especially since I wear glasses and can't stand when it makes my glasses slide around and I end up with those red marks due to friction of the glasses moving so much, so even though gel probably isn't the best for dry skin, it worked better for me. However, I've been considering using gel during the day, then a thicker one at night, (I've never used a different one at night, since I'm disabled and can't afford to splurge on skincare, even on drugstore unless it's very cheap and I find Neutrogena to be a bit up there in price for drugstore, but it's the only moisturizer I didn't hate lol, so it's definitely considered a splurge for me). But I didn't want to buy one, then end up not liking it, since that would be money wasted, which I can't afford and I live in a small town, so the nearest Walmart is around 40 minutes away, so returning things isn't easy when we only go once a month, due to budget with gas and all that. But the water cream actually sounds like it might be a good option, since it's supposed to absorb fast and is from a line I trust, so I might try that out if I can find the smaller, more affordable size to test out before getting the bigger one. I'm hopeful, since the Hydro Boost line has been one of my favorite lines of all time, the only time one caused issues was when I accidentally got the fragranced version of the body gel lotion, but I gave that one to my grandma and got the fragrance free version and that one was perfect. (I'm very sensitive to fragrances in all skincare, including Deodorant, so I don't use fragranced products unless it's completely unavoidable, so I'm very very glad these products don't have fragrance).",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJOHSaNyb4E,youtube,en

2024-01-04,*NEW* Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Cream And Water Gel Review,"So that's what's going on. I needed a new jar of my holy grail moisturizer about two weeks ago and was very confused! 
I used to apply the 'water gel' sometimes under a more occlusive cream or sunscreen  and sometimes just as is. Always worked great for me. I thought, the 'water cream' might be a good alternative for winter, being a bit more occlusive, but I'm not totally sold. I just don't like it quite as much. It absorbs fast enough, true, but leaves a 'silicon-y' feel on my skin, which I don't enjoy (even though I know, it's not a bad thing). And it most certainly doesn't keep my skin hydrated for 72hours. It's always a bit dry and oily towards the late afternoon, when I come home from work. It's due to the dry, heated air inside, of course, but the cream most certainly doesn't keep that promise. Not even on my very 'robust' and healthy skin. I also have to clean the area around my eyes very carefully with very diluted alcohol, before I apply mascara later on. Again, that damn silicon layer. It sits on my skin and smudges my mascara within an hour or so. Didn't have that problem with the 'water gel'. I'll use it up and give the other option a try as well...but so far, this is not an improvement for me, unfortunately.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJOHSaNyb4E,youtube,en

2024-04-09,Dr. Sugai Reviews: Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Fragrance-Free Regenerating Cream with Retinol SA,"I‚Äôm 37. No visible wrinkles, to others anyway. People say I look great. But I do see the wrinkles coming in, especially on my forehead. It used to be only whenever I made a face, and then then last year it was only in certain lighting. Now it‚Äôs becoming to where you can just see a big wrinkly forehead no matter what. Just to paint the picture of what I‚Äôm like.

But how often do I need to use this cream? I know it‚Äôs not prescription cream. But for now I‚Äôm trying it like once per week. Maybe twice per week. Sometimes I do see redness in the face a few days later and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs from this or if it‚Äôs Just normal. So I don‚Äôt want to use too much mainly because I don‚Äôt want my coworkers to see that I‚Äôm using a product. But if I need to use it more often I can. Do you build a tolerance? Sounds like it from the way you are talking. I personally don‚Äôt put it on at night because then what if I rub it in my eyes? Or if it gets on my pillowcase and stuff like that.

But from what you‚Äôre saying it sounds like this already has those ingredients. So maybe no need to my mom also had me buying Olay crows feet. That was my first retinol, I started a few months ago. I was putting it on my mouth lines and crows feet and I went ahead and just did my forehead anyway. But now that I have this Neutrogena retinol cream, do I even need to use that Olay crows feet?? it just seems like the same thing but weaker.
