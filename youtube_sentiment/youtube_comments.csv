@Dr Dray please recommend some good non-comedogenic moisturizers withoout citric acid,tocopherol and any sort of oilsüò≠",GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-04-29,,
youtube,I love neutrogena skincare! They also discontinued the Daily moisturizer with AHA and Spf 15...heartbroken!,GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-02-28,,
youtube,"I picked up the water gel randomly as my first moisturizer. I LOVE the way this feels when I put it on! I get so excited. It‚Äôs refreshing. 

Idk if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm 36 or if I have some issue, but in the past year my forehead has developed wrinkles and I now have mouth lines and this weird big line on my face and my cheeks have a texture instead of normal. Like a spongey rock look. 

So I‚Äôm developing a skin care routine for the first time ever. I‚Äôm using OLAY Eyes as suggested by my mom. Putting it under my eyes and on the sides. And on smile lines. Then I‚Äôm doing the neutrogena moisturizer over. This is when I‚Äôm not at work. On days I work, I‚Äôm just doing moisturizer and skipping OLAY. Idk why. Just in case it looks weird. 

Then at night I do 2 serums this local guy made. One has hyslouronic acid. Hope I‚Äôm not getting too much hyaluroni c acid between my night serum and morning moisturizer.

So far after a few weeks I‚Äôm not sure I see a difference but maybe time will tell. 

My nails also look weird and my throat is really dry and so are my lips so perhaps bloodwork will show I have some dehydration issue idk.",GJOHSaNyb4E,2024-02-23,,

I don't know how to explain. hahaha, but I like the current look of my face skin when I started to use this neutrogena hydro boost water gel compared to the hyaluronic acid that I used before.
